Hub
======

# Overview

Hub is a lean and mean little service, designed to consolidate, process and publish different sources of models, data 
and statuses, across all sites. Think Enterprise-service-bus for multi-site science collaborations.

# Getting started

    git clone https://github.com/nesi/hub.git
    cd hub
    ./gradlew clean build
